Accounting, Accounting is part of measuring, communicating, and interpreting financial activity. Whether you are preparing a household budget, balancing your cheque book, preparing your income tax return, or running a large corporation you are working with accounting concepts and accounting information.
Anthropology, Anthropology is the study of human culture and the many forms it takes in different societies, both past and present. It traces the evolution of culture beyond its primate origins, through over two million years of prehistory, to historical and contemporary societies.
Applied Geology, Applied Geology looks at how geological issues affect the lives of human beings. It studies the effects of naturally-occurring geological hazards, such as landslides and volcanic eruptions, environmental problems from such areas as waste disposal and groundwater contamination, and looks at how to manage and access natural resources, such as petroleum and minerals.
Applied Science, The University of Otago's Applied Science programme combines the excitement of science and technology with the challenges of business. It is an innovative programme for high-achieving students offering an undergraduate honours degree and masters programmes. Applied Science helps students prepare for careers in growth areas like information and communication technology and biotechnology.
Archaeology, Archaeology is the study of the material evidence of the human past. This evidence can include monumental structures like the ceremonial statues and platforms of Easter Island as well as smaller portable artifacts such as pots and stone tools.
Art History and Visual Culture, The Art History and Visual Culture teaching programme is designed to equip students with the concepts and language necessary for contemporary discussion of art, art history, art theory and art criticism. The special focus of the programme is the diversity of theory in the discourses of art.
Asian Studies, Asian Studies is an interdisciplinary programme for students who wish to combine training in an Asian language with courses devoted to developing an understanding of the history, culture, politics and economics of the countries of the Asian region.
Business Law, Law is a crucial ingredient in all business dealings. A business education is certainly incomplete if it fails to include one or more courses which develop legal knowledge and skills along with a practical appreciation of the fact that all commercial relationships and transactions have legal consequences. One or more papers in the Business Law area are therefore highly recommended to those completing a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom), whatever their major subject. Some occupations require more - for example, those who plan to become chartered accountants are required to complete three papers of Business Law.
Biblical Studies, Biblical Studies is devoted to the study of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, looking at the origins of the biblical writings and the history of their interpretation.
Biochemistry, Biochemistry combines the molecular approach of chemistry with the breadth and diversity of biology. Very much a laboratory science, it explores, unravels and explains every aspect of the structure and function of all living things at the molecular level.
Bioengineering, Biological engineering, biotechnological engineering or bioengineering (including biological systems engineering) is the application of engineering principles to address challenges in the fields of biology and medicine.
Biology, Biology is the study of living organisms and is the basis of all studies in the life sciences. At Otago, Biology is used as a name for courses at 100-level only. There is no Department of Biology.
Botany, Botany covers all aspects of the life of plants. It therefore includes their structure and development, physiology and biochemistry, health and disease, relationships with other organisms and the environment (ecology), as well as the traditional aspects of plant identification and classification.
Buddhist Studies, Buddhism is the dominant religion in many Asian countries and has played an important role in the history and culture of Asia.
Business Administration, Combining a strong global perspective with the diversity of our classes and opportunities for international exchange to renowned universities worldwide, students are prepared for success in the highly competitive global economy.
Chaplaincy, The study of Chaplaincy is aimed at enhancing chaplaincy in a range of contemporary settings, through the incorporation of current scholarship into the practice of chaplaincy.
Chemistry, Chemistry has come a long way since the ancients used it for brewing, cosmetics, pottery, metallurgy and embalming, and since the alchemists tried to use chemistry to find the elixir of life or to change lead into gold.
Chinese, Asia is important to New Zealand's future. For economic, political and cultural reasons, New Zealand's involvement with Asia and the Pacific is desirable, inevitable and irreversible. It is crucial that New Zealanders know more about Asia, understand its cultures, history, political and economic systems and learn its languages. Links between New Zealand and Chinese-speaking countries and regions are rapidly growing.
Classics, Classics is the study of the civilisations of ancient Greece and Rome. The importance of the Greeks and Romans is their immense influence on the development of western civilisation. Our language, literature, art, drama, philosophy, political and legal systems, art and architecture are all derived from Greece and Rome.
Clothing and Textile Sciences, Clothing and many materials such as textiles and leather meet basic human needs, and are essential to performance, feelings of well-being in both the physical sense (e.g. for protection and warmth) and the social sense (e.g. belonging to a group). Clothing plays an important role in non-verbal communication indicating many personal and social characteristics of the wearer. Clothing and textile production and distribution are significant to the New Zealand and world economy, and clothing and textiles are one of the few product groups subject to control in international trade.
Composition, A comprehensive training in Composition (including Music Technology and Song-Writing) to students at all levels of study. Broad-ranging in content, composition at Otago offers students training in many forms of musical creativity and music style.
Computer and Information Science, Computer and Information Science includes the 100-level papers for both Information Science and Computer Science.
Computational Modelling, Computational Modelling is all about formulating and modelling real-world problems, then developing solution methods to analyse these problems on a computer.
Computer Science, Computer Science is the study of computers and the work they do. We need a science of computers because, unlike other machines, computers are general purpose; the same machine can perform many different tasks and the same tasks can be done equally well by different computers.
Dance Studies, The Dance Studies programme at the University of Otago provides a unique opportunity to study dance as a major focus within the Arts and Sciences.
Dentistry, Dentistry is an important part of the health service. It offers a rewarding and worthwhile career to anyone who has an interest in and a concern for the needs of people, an even temperament and a sense of precision. As a profession Dentistry gives an unusual opportunity to contribute to appearance, well-being and general health. One of its great attractions is its emphasis on caring for people and encouraging them to find the means to care for themselves.
Early Childhood Education, Early childhood teaching qualifications enable individuals to study under the guidance of internationally-recognised early childhood academics, researchers and teachers. A range of qualifications will be offered especially for individuals who want to teach in early childhood centres or kindergartens in New Zealand and overseas.
Earth and Ocean Science, EAOS 111 Earth and Ocean Science, looks at the evolution of continents and oceans; sea-floor spreading, mountain ranges, plate tectonics; oceanic circulation and global cycles; erosion, landslides and sedimentation on land and sea; marine biological systems, evolution of life through the ages; oceans and climate; the Solar System.
Ecology, Ecology is the study of animals and plants in relation to their environment. Revived interest in environmental and ecological issues and the public and governmental concern and debate over such matters has created a need for scientifically trained ecologists. An Ecology degree produces graduates with a background which will enable them to make rational judgements on ecological matters, either as professional ecologists or as educated members of the public.
Economics, Economics is about choice and is at the heart of all decision-making. Governments, businesses and individuals are all faced with making choices in situations where resources are scarce. As a result, Economics is applicable in a wide range of fields, including business, finance, administration, law, local and national government and, indeed, most aspects of everyday life. One of the strengths of Economics is that it provides a logical way of looking at a variety of issues. It is not just a subject - it is a way of thinking.
Education, Education programmes provide a critical analysis of contemporary educational theories, policies and practices. Education papers also enhance students' programmes in related fields of history, psychology, social work, and other major subjects.
Electronics, Electronics is a rapidly changing area, and is a major growth industry worldwide. It includes electronic communications technologies such as radio and lasers, large-scale integrated electronics systems, and the software that governs the application of this technology.
English, Language is power. We use language for the whole range of activities that make us human, from passion to politics; we negotiate through language in every waking moment of our lives. Literature is language at its most effective.
Environmental Science, Environmental Science focuses on understanding how the environment works, so that environmental damage can be minimised, or repaired.
Finance, Finance is a modern and fascinating discipline dealing with money, markets and valuation, that is relevant to all aspects of business and personal and professional planning. Professionals in finance are involved with a myriad of issues in investments, planning and risk. The subject is often confused with accounting. However, while both deal with money and value, accounting is concerned with systems of control, and recording and reporting the results of historical transactions. By contrast finance is concerned with the relationship between investor expectations about the future and current market values. By focusing on markets the subject can also be confused with economics. However economics deals with broad issues of resource allocation, whereas finance focuses more narrowly on how markets value risk and the implications for investment, financial planning, shareholder wealth and corporate governance.
Food Science, Understanding food, its components, quality and consumer appeal are the ingredients of Food Science. At the University of Otago, Food Science papers aim to prepare people for creative, challenging, diverse and rewarding food industry careers.
French, Spoken in 47 countries, French is a language of major significance in the international arena. The French Programme, which is part of the Department of Languages and Cultures, offers a full range of courses for all levels, from Introductory French for beginners to postgraduate programmes for advanced students.
Forensic Biology, Increasingly, forensic investigations have come to rely on the techniques of forensic biology to provide vital evidence in homicides, violent crimes, disaster identification and even minor crimes. These techniques are also commonly used in a wide range of professional areas such as the investigation of crimes against humanity, forensic archaeology and wildlife protection.
Gender Studies, Gender is a complex element of social and cultural existence with far-reaching implications for the course of our lives. It shapes the work we do and how we spend our leisure time, our income, our family relationships and friendships, the value and meanings we attach to other people and activities, what we eat and how we dress, and even how we speak and move. In the last few decades, theoretical and everyday notions of gender have undergone dramatic changes, influenced both by changes in the organisation of society and by a rapidly expanding field of critical inquiry.   
Genetics, Genetics combines the classical approaches of Mendelian genetics and cyto-genetics with the recently developed discipline of molecular genetics. Very much a practical science, it also has a complex and interesting theoretical foundation.
General Practice, The discipline of general practice involves comprehensive, continuing, community-based medical care of individuals and families with an emphasis on prevention of disease and the earliest possible identification and intervention.
Geography, Geographers seek to understand the web of interactions and interconnections which link people and the environment. To succeed in that they require a firm grounding in a number of study areas.
German, German involves the systematic study of a language that is a close cousin of English. German culture has contributed greatly to the development of literature, science, philosophy, music and the visual arts in the western world. Consequently the study of German enhances the study of many other disciplines. German is one of the major European languages and Germany's influence in Europe has been growing steadily since the opening up of Eastern Europe in 1989.
Greek, Greek and Latin papers offer both linguistic training and the experience of reading the major works of Greek and Roman literature, drama, history and philosophy in the original languages. The languages are also an essential tool for postgraduate work in Classics.
Health Informatics, Electronic information systems are revolutionising health-care practice, research and education. Efficient management of information improves patient satisfaction and makes time available for new aspects of practice and for learning. Many health-care professionals realise they need skills in finding and using information, and in assessing information systems.
Health Sciences, A wide range of postgraduate courses in specialist areas of Health Sciences is available including a Master of Health Sciences (MHealSc) degree.
History, History moves like tectonic plates: mostly imperceptibly, but sometimes with astonishing ruptures. What kinds of historical shifts lie behind a Brexit, a Trump, or a Treaty of Waitangi for that matter? What counts as historical truth in a world of ‘alternative facts’? Studying history provides students with a deep feeling for the ways time has shaped today’s complex world, and the intellectual tools to tackle an enticingly wide range of professional and career challenges.
Hospitality, The Hospitality minor provides an introduction to the workings of hospitality businesses. While it recognises links to the wider tourism system, its focus is primarily on issues that face individual hospitality businesses. The minor gives students a grounding in the fundamentals of business operation that set the hospitality sector apart from other business sectors, including: issues associated with co-creation of the 'product'; the significance of human resources management; the impact of seasonality; yield (revenue) management; and the unique nature of distribution for hospitality products.
International Business, The major in International Business is a recent development within the School of Business (Commerce Division). It recognises that business is being conducted in a dynamic, global environment and that organisations, both in New Zealand and through the world, need individuals who can work across the traditional functional boundaries as well as across national borders.
Irish Studies, Irish Studies at Otago is an interdisciplinary study of the literature, history, film and theatre of the island of Ireland over the past two hundred years. While it focuses on issues such as identity, ethnicity, and 'nation building', and the history of their contestation, it also pays attention to Ireland's relationships with New Zealand, Europe and Australia.
Islamic Studies, With over a billion followers and a history covering some 1400 years, the religion of Islam and the cultures of the Muslim world together represent a very significant part of world civilization. The BA in Islamic Studies will equip you to understand Islam from a range of different perspectives. You will study the historical roots of the tradition, the primary religious scriptures of Islam and the theological, philosophical, legal, political and mystical traditions which are based upon them as well as the varied cultures of Islam in many different countries of the world.
Information Science, Information Science refers to the study of computer-based information systems, problem-solving techniques, and the application of these to a wide range of commercial, scientific and industrial settings.
Japanese, Japanese papers offered at undergraduate level emphasise language acquisition and introduce Japanese culture through a variety of media, including literature, films and videos
Latin, Latin and Greek papers offer both linguistic training and the experience of reading the major works of Greek and Roman literature, drama, history and philosophy in the original languages
Law, Law permeates all social activity. It defines relationships, protects rights, imposes obligations and gives structure to governmental and commercial enterprise.
Linguistics, Language is central, and perhaps unique, to human experience. Interest in its study has existed throughout history. Consequently, questions about language, and particularly the nature of its structure, use and development, have engaged scholars from a wide range of disciplines. Linguistics is the discipline that addressses these and other related questions directly.
Management, The value of study in management cannot be overestimated. Whatever your interests in life and work and whatever your future hopes, wishes and goals, management will help you succeed. Management skills are needed by everyone in a position of responsibility. For example the top jobs in manufacturing, commerce, healthcare, education, legal, nonprofit, recreational and science organisations will include managerial responsibilities. Management is equally applicable to self-employment, small business, national businesses, government organisations and multinational companies.
Marine Science, At undergraduate level, topics in Marine Science are offered through a BSc in Ecology with a minor in Marine Science, a BSc in Oceanography and a BAppSc in Aquaculture and Fisheries. Minors in all three areas are available for a number of bachelors’ degrees.
Mathematics, From accounting to zoology, wherever there is a need to quantify and analyse, there is an application of mathematics or its close ally, statistics. Mathematics provides the language and means to understand the symbolic and quantitative aspects of much of our knowledge, so many students will combine the study of Mathematics with Statistics, Computer Science and/or Information Science, a physical science (such as Geology, Chemistry or Physics), applied science (Engineering, Surveying), biological science, social science (Education, Psychology), commerce (Economics, Finance), or the humanities (Linguistics, Philosophy). And, quite apart from its usefulness, many students take mathematics simply because they like it! It is a subject with a strong cultural element, encapsulating much of the history of scientific discovery from the ancient Greek geometers to the latest developments in the theory of chaos.
Medicine, The Medical course at the University of Otago takes six years and leads to the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MB ChB).
Microbiology, Microbiology is the study of the large and diverse group of living organisms of microscopic size which includes viruses, bacteria, fungi, algae, worms and protozoa. Microbiology is the science which is concerned with the study of micro-organisms including their distribution and role in the environment and their relationship to other living organisms including humans (in health and disease) and other animals. An understanding of the basic nature and molecular structure of the microbes has been a major factor in the advancement of molecular biology as a scientific discipline and in establishing microbial genetics as an advancing science.
Ministry, For further information please refer to the subject entry for Theology.
Music,Music has an important place in the lives of people in all cultures, and the study of music enriches any student's university programme, opening doors to lifelong learning and enjoyment

Nursing, Nursing is available as an endorsment.
Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The University of Otago offers seven distance taught papers in obstetrics and gynaecology designed for family planning trainees, midwives, general practitioners, continuing medical education registrants and Postgraduate Diploma in Obstetrics and Medical Gynaecology (PGDipOMG) candidates.
Oceanography, Nothing on this planet connects local, national and global issues as much as the ocean. Oceanography at Otago includes study in marine physics, chemistry and geology. It develops from large-scale global systems such as ocean circulation in first year to topical local issues such as dredging Otago Harbour in third year.
Pathology, The minor in Pathology provides an avenue for students majoring in related disciplines such as Biochemistry, Microbiology, Genetics, Anatomy and  Physiology to gain formal recognition for this knowledge acquisition.
Peace and Conflict Studies, The Master of Arts (MA) in Peace and Conflict Studies and Master of Peace and Conflict Studies (MPCS) are inter-disciplinary programmes providing advanced qualifications in peace and conflict studies, development and peace building. They focus on the sources of social and political violence and war at local, national and international levels and how these might be prevented, managed and transformed in more peaceful directions
Performance, The Department of Music, Theatre and Performing Arts’ music performance programmes develop a student’s performing potential through lessons and workshops under expert staff guidance.
Performing Arts, By studying Performing Arts students are able to develop their knowledge and skills in a variety of different performance forms, and to learn about the history, theories and key practitioners in the worlds of Theatre, Dance and Music.
Pharmacy, Pharmacists are health professionals. They are the experts on medicine in the community. They have the skills and knowledge to help patients understand and use their medicines in the most appropriate way. The practice of pharmacy includes the development and manufacture of medicines, the supply and dispensing of medicines to patients, and the giving of information about medicines, drug therapy and disease management to patients, doctors and other health professionals.
Pharmacology, Pharmacology is about the effects of chemicals on living organisms. In practice it deals mainly with the effects of drugs on animals, especially human beings. It is concerned with how drugs produce their effects, the sources, properties, distribution, elimination and uses of drugs and other chemicals. Drug effects may be useful, as in medicine (clinical pharmacology), or harmful (toxicology).
Philosophy, The questions which philosophers discuss are so basic and so general that at some time or other most people have come across them. Philosophy is the attempt to assess the foundations of our beliefs and the principles we live by.
Philosophy Politics and Economics, Philosophy, Politics and Economics is a multidisciplinary programme that incorporates an attractive and intellectually stimulating combination of three long-established and influential disciplines. There are natural affinities and common roots among several strands of Philosophy, Political Studies and Economics. For example, Economics developed from the field of Political Economy, Welfare Economics utilises concepts of social justice from Philosophy, and the Philosophy of Science has important implications for methodologies adopted in Economics and Politics. The aim of the programme is to give a broader exposure to the range of analytical approaches in these three disciplines than would be gained within any one of the traditional single-discipline majors.
Physical Education, The University of Otago is the only university in New Zealand to offer study in Physical Education at Bachelor's, Master's and Doctoral levels.
Physics, Physics tries to answer the bottom-line questions: What? and Why? when we see things in nature that are not understood. For instance, why is the sky blue whereas sunsets are red? What happens when a star explodes? What is radiation? What causes an aurora? Physics also involves the application of this knowledge to other fields. For instance, if you really understand about lasers then you will be better placed to develop new uses for them in applications such as communications, engineering and medical science. Often students take a degree in Physics because they have a particular career in mind, but for many their first priority is simply to understand Physics. They take Physics because it interests them.
Politics, Politics is the study of how power is organised and used, theoretically, nationally and internationally. Power relations affect every aspect of our lives, determining what we think, say and do, and how we co-operate to make the world a better place.
Psychology, Psychology is the science of behaviour. Psychologists study the way humans (and other animals) interact with the world and each other.
Religious Studies, Religious Studies seeks both to understand religion as a universal human phenomenon and to explore the variety of ways in which people express their religious commitments in thought and action. Since Religious Studies students study a wide variety of societies and cultures, this is a subject which can be profitably included within most courses of study.
Science Communication, The Centre for Science Communication (CSC) is one of the world’s largest postgraduate facilities for the teaching, research, and practice of communicating science to the general public. It is part of the University of Otago in Dunedin, a UNESCO City of Literature. Dunedin is the wildlife capital of New Zealand with colonies of seals, albatross and penguins all living within the city's boundaries. It is no accident that it has also become a centre for those involved in natural history filmmaking. The Centre for Science Communication has strong links with the publishing industry, the world’s second-largest producer of documentaries (NHNZ) and the Otago Museum which is undergoing significant redevelopment of its galleries with a focus on science engagement.
Sociology, Sociology is the study of people, societies and social groups. The aim of sociology is to understand and explain aspects of social behaviour and relationships.
Software Engineering, Software Engineering is about the sound construction of computer systems for today and tomorrow. This includes areas such as modelling complex interactive systems, identifying how computer information systems can be made to improve performance, managing the construction of information systems, and ensuring that procedures are in place for system testing and maintenance.
Sports Business, In recent years the sports industry in New Zealand and elsewhere, has grown exponentially and become increasingly business-orientated. Its development extends across many sectors of the economy from sports-oriented marketing, law and tourism, and event management to the personal fitness industry and athlete/sport management. There is a growing need for qualified managers for sport, recreation and leisure organisations and businesses - careers available to students who are enthusiastic about sport, and academically qualified in both business and sport-related subjects.
Statistics, Statistics as a field of study is concerned with the collection, analysis and interpretation of numerical data. The main emphasis is on the role of random variation in observations that are made, which is why statistical theory is built on the concepts of probability.
Surveying, Surveying embraces a range of activities related to the measurement, ownership and delineation of our physical resources, whether these be on the land or in the oceans.
Teaching, The University of Otago College of Education offers a number of teaching qualifications for those interested in at early childhood, primary (including primary bicultural) and secondary education. There are also specialist programmes offered at the Southland Campus in Te Pokai Matauranga o te Ao Rua (Primary Bicultural Education).
Theatre Studies, Theatre Studies at Otago is based in Allen Hall Theatre, which is a working theatre featuring a very full programme of lunchtime and evening productions throughout the academic year. You will become involved in productions at the theatre, (both onstage and backstage) as part of your course work.
Tourism, Tourism is an interdisciplinary field of study that has links to business studies, resource analysis, social theory and environmental studies. The Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) majoring in Tourism degree helps students develop an understanding of the key issues surrounding tourism, its impact and ongoing management. 
Zoology, Zoology is the study of the biology of animals. This simple definition, however, hides the complexity of the subject. There are many levels at which the biology of animals can be studied: molecular, physiological, structural, evolutionary, behavioural and ecological. Our courses emphasise the diversity and conservation of New Zealand's unique animals.
